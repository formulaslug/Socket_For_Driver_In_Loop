<h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>

This folder contains the entirety of the full vehicle simulation for Formula Slug. It is run from [main.py](main.py) where you provide the necessary parameters to begin the simulation. There are a few main folders: ```Powertrain``` (Powertrain/Battery System), ```Mech```  (Mechanical System), ```SimulationInputs``` and ```TireModel``` (Tire Model Training). ```Powertrain``` and ```Mech``` are model bits used while running the simulation. ```SimulationInputs``` contains various simulation starting points: Initial parameters like timeStep, and control inputs for the duration of a simulation.

If you want more information on the basis of some of these simulation parts, you can find them in [GeneralModelingNotes.md](GeneralModelingNotes.md)

<h3 id="pars"> Simulation Parameters </h3>

This is a json input file with a bunch of inputs for the simulation. Unfortunately JSON doesn't support comments so the unit explanations have to go here. The file is [params.json](params.json). Tweak this for all the indepth constants and higher level stuff like step size and simulation duration.

<h3 id="ctrls"> Simulation Controls </h3>

Simulation controls is a ```.csv``` or ```.parquet``` file that contains ```time (sec)```, ```throttle (-1 to 1)```, ```brake(Pressure)```, and ```steering angle``` inputs. Time is in seconds, throttle is -1 to 1 (includes regen), brakes is in ```PSI```, and steering angle is in radians. The full vehicle simulation will do interpolation automatically to align the input/simulation time steps as needed. You can select from CS for cubic spline for continuous data from a run or LI for linear interpolation for a simpler input.


<h2 id="msc"> Main Simulation Systems </h2>

The simulation is divided into subsystems. The Powertrain contains the entire powertrain model, namely the tractive battery electrical/thermal systems. The mechanical system includes/will include suspension modeling, steering modeling, aero modeling, brake modeling, and tire modeling.
